# Intuition
Given a singly linked list representing a non-negative integer where each node contains a single digit (0-9), the goal is to double the integer value the list represents. This can be accomplished by doubling each node's value starting from the head of the list while taking into account any carry-over from the doubling process. Since the list represents the integer in reverse order (least significant digit at the head), the process of doubling each node and handling the carry-over recursively from the head to the tail seems like a natural approach.

# Approach
1. Traverse the linked list from head to tail recursively while doubling each node's value.
2. Keep track of the carry-over as you proceed through the list.
3. For each node, double its value and add the carry-over from the previous iteration.
4. Update the node's value with the unit's digit from the result (i.e., %10) and compute the carry-over for the next iteration.
5. If you reach the end of the list and there is carry left over, append a new node at the beginning of the list with the carry value.
6. Return the head of the linked list after doubling the values and handling the carry-over.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:The algorithm traverses the linked list once to perform the doubling operation on each node and handle carry-over, making the time complexity linear with respect to the number of nodes in the list.
- Space complexity: The recursive approach could lead to a stack depth of up to n (length of the list) due to function calls, giving a space complexity of O(n). In addition, if there's a carry left over, an extra node may be added at the beginning of the list, but this doesn't significantly change the space complexity.
